# Ubuntu 24.04 CIS Benchmark Audit Automation

This project automates the auditing of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS systems using a collection of custom CIS benchmark scripts. It ensures system compliance by running checks and saving their results in a structured format.

## 🚀 Features

- Verifies the system is Ubuntu **24.04 LTS**
- Runs all `.sh` audit scripts under the `script/` directory
- Requires **root privileges** for full access to system settings
- Saves detailed output per script in the `result/` folder
- Captures system info (hostname, timestamp, Ubuntu version)
- Packages all results into a ZIP archive


## ⚠️ Requirements

- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**
- Must run with **root** privileges (`sudo`)
- Bash shell

## ✅ Usage

```bash
sudo ./run_audit.sh
```
📦 Output
Individual audit results: result/AUDIT_script_name.txt

System info summary: result/System_Info.txt

All outputs zipped: audit_reports.zip

🔎 Output Result Types
Each script returns one of the following result types:

Result	Description
PASS	The system meets the CIS benchmark requirement.
FAIL	The system does not meet the CIS benchmark requirement.
MANUAL	The check must be verified manually (e.g., requires visual review).
SKIP	The check is not applicable to this system or intentionally ignored.

🛠 Customize
Add or edit scripts inside the script/ directory to expand coverage or tailor checks for your environment.

🔐 Security Note
This tool performs read-only audits and does not apply any changes to the system.
